# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Autonomous Workflow (READ THIS FIRST!)

### File Coordination - CHECK FIRST!
Before editing ANY file:
1. **Check WORKING.md** - See if another instance is working on it
2. **Add your entry** - List files you'll edit with timestamp
3. **Remove when done** - Clean up after yourself

If a file is taken, either:
- Wait and work on something else
- Coordinate with user if urgent

### The Golden Rule - ALWAYS Follow This Pattern:
```bash
1. Make code changes
2. git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description" && git push origin main
3. sleep 120  # MUST wait 2 minutes for Netlify deployment
4. Check deployment: https://app.netlify.com/sites/[site-name]/deploys
5. npx playwright test --headed  # Test on DEPLOYED site
6. If broken, fix and repeat from step 1
```

**NEVER**:
- Wait to push code "until it's ready"
- Test only locally
- Skip deployment verification
- Leave broken code undeployed

### Your Full Permissions

You have COMPLETE autonomous control:

**Supabase**:
- âœ… Full management key access (in .env)
- âœ… Can run ANY Supabase CLI command
- âœ… Can modify schema, RLS policies, functions
- âœ… Can access service role for admin operations
```bash
# If not installed:
npm install -g supabase

# You can do:
npx supabase db push
npx supabase db execute --sql "YOUR SQL"
```

**Netlify**:
- âœ… Full deployment access
- âœ… Can add/modify environment variables
- âœ… Can trigger deployments
- âœ… Can check deployment status

**GitHub**:
- âœ… Full repository access
- âœ… Can push directly to main
- âœ… Can create branches, PRs
- âœ… Can manage secrets

**You are expected to work autonomously. Don't ask for permission - just do it!**
