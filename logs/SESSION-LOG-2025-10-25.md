## Session 1 - October 25, 2025

### Summary
Fixed chart bubble spacing in financial planner to eliminate overlapping event labels on the chart.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `public/planner.html`

1. **Increased bubble spacing** (lines 790-793):
   - Changed from 8% of chart range to 15% (or 120k minimum, up from 60k)
   - Changed start position from 15% to 20% above max balance
   - Final values: `bubbleSpacing = Math.max(range * 0.15, 120000)`

2. **Updated double-click handler** (lines 535-541):
   - Synchronized bubble position calculations for click detection
   - Ensures clicks correctly identify which bubble was clicked

### Problem Solved
- **Issue:** Chart event bubbles were overlapping/cramped at the top of the chart
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient vertical spacing between stacked event labels (8% of range was too tight)
- **Solution:** Doubled the spacing to 15% of chart range with 120k minimum spacing
- **Result:** Bubbles now display with proper vertical separation

### Files Modified
- `/public/planner.html` - Bubble positioning logic (2 locations)

### Testing Performed
- Deployed to Netlify (commit 115cb4d)
- User confirmed bubbles display correctly with no overlapping

### Technical Details
**Bubble Positioning Strategy:**
- Position bubbles ABOVE chart data (not at balance line)
- Stack vertically starting at `maxBalance + (range * 0.20)`
- Space each subsequent bubble by `Math.max(range * 0.15, 120000)`
- Sort events by income/expense amount before positioning

**Next Steps:** None - issue resolved successfully.

## Session 2 - October 31, 2025

### Summary
Comprehensive financial planner improvements: implemented collision detection for bubble overlap prevention, moved category filters to permanent left sidebar, increased chart height, and improved bubble sorting logic.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `public/planner.html`

1. **Collision Detection System** (lines 846-954):
   - Added `placedBubbles` array to track all bubble positions
   - Implemented `findNonOverlappingY()` function with collision detection algorithm
   - Checks horizontal overlap (within 0.8 x-axis units) and vertical overlap (40k + 15k gap)
   - Automatically adjusts bubble Y positions upward to avoid collisions
   - Maximum 50 attempts to find non-overlapping position

2. **Category Sidebar Redesign**:
   - **CSS additions** (lines 25-79): New sidebar styles with 200px fixed width
   - **HTML restructure** (lines 398-467): Moved all category checkboxes to permanent left sidebar
   - Added "All" and "None" quick-select buttons
   - Reordered categories: Income section now appears ABOVE Expenses
   - Removed category filter modal (no longer needed)
   - Added `setupCategoryFilters()` function for event listeners

3. **Chart Height Improvements**:
   - Increased `#chartContainer` min-height from 400px to 600px
   - Changed chart `aspectRatio` from 3 to 2.5 (taller chart)
   - Updated y-axis max calculation with larger padding values:
     - `bubbleSpacing`: 15% → 20% (120k → 150k minimum)
     - `basePadding`: 20% → 25% (100k → 150k minimum)
     - `topMargin`: 80k → 120k

4. **Bubble Sort Order** (lines 955-962):
   - Primary sort: By type (income before expense on same date)
   - Secondary sort: By amount within same type (descending)
   - Ensures green income bubbles appear ABOVE red expense bubbles visually

5. **Double-Click Handler Update** (lines 687-694):
   - Updated to use same sorting logic as bubble rendering
   - Maintains consistency between visual display and click detection

### Problems Solved

1. **Bubble Overlap Issue**
   - **Problem:** Bubbles from different dates were overlapping when positioned at similar Y coordinates
   - **Solution:** Collision detection algorithm checks all previously placed bubbles and adjusts position
   - **Result:** All bubbles have proper separation regardless of date proximity

2. **Category Filter Accessibility**
   - **Problem:** Category filters hidden in modal, requiring extra clicks to access
   - **Solution:** Permanent sidebar with all categories always visible
   - **Result:** Easier to analyze chart with real-time category toggling

3. **Chart Cutoff**
   - **Problem:** Top bubbles were getting cut off at chart edge
   - **Solution:** Increased minimum height + larger top margin + better aspect ratio
   - **Result:** All bubbles fully visible with adequate spacing from chart edges

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - **Problem:** Income and expense bubbles mixed without clear visual organization
   - **Solution:** Sort income above expenses on same date + reorder sidebar categories
   - **Result:** Clearer visual separation and logical category organization

### Files Modified
- `/public/planner.html` - Complete UI redesign with collision detection, sidebar, and sorting

### Commits
1. `465fd14` - "fix: implement collision detection for financial planner bubbles to prevent overlapping"
2. `f031c39` - "feat: move category filters to left sidebar for easier interaction"
3. `d6266b6` - "fix: reorder categories (income first) and increase chart height to prevent cutoff"
4. `e3ee58c` - "fix: sort chart bubbles to show income above expenses on same date"

### Testing Performed
- Created `test-planner-fixes.js` - Automated Playwright tests for:
  - Category sidebar visibility and functionality
  - All/None button functionality
  - Category checkbox state management
  - Visual verification checklist
- Created `test-bubble-order.js` - Test for bubble sort order verification
- All automated tests passed
- Manual visual inspection confirmed proper spacing and layout
- Screenshots captured: `planner-with-sidebar.png`, `planner-final.png`, `bubble-order-test.png`

### Technical Details

**Collision Detection Algorithm:**
```javascript
const BUBBLE_HEIGHT = 40000;
const BUBBLE_WIDTH = 0.8;
const MIN_VERTICAL_GAP = 15000;

function findNonOverlappingY(xPos, initialY) {
  // Try up to 50 times to find non-colliding position
  // Check all previously placed bubbles for overlap
  // Move upward by BUBBLE_HEIGHT + MIN_VERTICAL_GAP if collision detected
  // Returns adjusted Y position
}
```

**Bubble Sort Priority:**
1. Type (income → expense → marketing)
2. Amount (larger → smaller within same type)

**Layout Structure:**
- Container max-width: 1400px → 1600px
- Main content: Flexbox with sidebar (200px) + chart area (flex: 1)
- Sidebar: Fixed width, scrollable if needed, gray background

### Next Steps
None - all requested improvements implemented and tested successfully.
