## Session 1 - October 25, 2025

### Summary
Fixed chart bubble spacing in financial planner to eliminate overlapping event labels on the chart.

### Changes Made

**File Modified:** `public/planner.html`

1. **Increased bubble spacing** (lines 790-793):
   - Changed from 8% of chart range to 15% (or 120k minimum, up from 60k)
   - Changed start position from 15% to 20% above max balance
   - Final values: `bubbleSpacing = Math.max(range * 0.15, 120000)`

2. **Updated double-click handler** (lines 535-541):
   - Synchronized bubble position calculations for click detection
   - Ensures clicks correctly identify which bubble was clicked

### Problem Solved
- **Issue:** Chart event bubbles were overlapping/cramped at the top of the chart
- **Root Cause:** Insufficient vertical spacing between stacked event labels (8% of range was too tight)
- **Solution:** Doubled the spacing to 15% of chart range with 120k minimum spacing
- **Result:** Bubbles now display with proper vertical separation

### Files Modified
- `/public/planner.html` - Bubble positioning logic (2 locations)

### Testing Performed
- Deployed to Netlify (commit 115cb4d)
- User confirmed bubbles display correctly with no overlapping

### Technical Details
**Bubble Positioning Strategy:**
- Position bubbles ABOVE chart data (not at balance line)
- Stack vertically starting at `maxBalance + (range * 0.20)`
- Space each subsequent bubble by `Math.max(range * 0.15, 120000)`
- Sort events by income/expense amount before positioning

**Next Steps:** None - issue resolved successfully.
